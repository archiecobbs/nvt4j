Version 1.1.0 Released November 17, 2015

    - Fixed infinite loop if EOF is encountered at startup (issue #1)

Version 1.0a1 Released April 28, 2008

    First alpha release. This code is quite limited but it already provides the basic
    functions needed to drive a terminal emulator for Java, namely putting the terminal
    driver in raw mode, turning off the cursor and client-side echo, and detecting the
    size of the terminal emulator window.

    This code has been tested only with xterm.
