NVT4J 1.0a1
-----------

First alpha release. This code is quite limited but it already provides the basic
functions needed to drive a terminal emulator for Java, namely putting the terminal
driver in raw mode, turning off the cursor and client-side echo, and detecting the
size of the terminal emulator window.

This code has been tested only with xterm.
